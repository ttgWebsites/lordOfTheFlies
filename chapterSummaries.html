					<li data-theme="b">Chapter 1</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The novel begins in the midpoint of an unspecified wartime evacuation, where a British plane carrying boys crashes onto an uninhabited island.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">While throwing rocks into the lagoon, a fair-haired boy meets a chubby boy wearing spectacles.</li>

					<li data-theme="c">Greatly intrigued by the whereabouts of the rest of the boys, Ralph and Piggy go looking for sign of life elsewhere.</li>

					<li data-theme="c">The loud sound of Ralph's blow in the conch alerts the other boys, and they quickly gather around Ralph. The pilot remains unfound.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The boys' ages range between 6 and 12. Jack is among the oldest, and is also head of the boy's choir.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Piggy quickly becomes an outcast within the circle of boys, due to his physical appearance as well as his funny nickname.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The boys elect a leader, and Ralph wins the vote. Jack is noticeably angered by this election, as he wanted to be leader.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Ralph decides to go explore the island, bringing Jack and a choirboy named Simon with him.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">During their exploration, the boys discover that they are the only humans living on the island.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">On their way back to the beach, the boys stumble upon a wild pig tangled in vines. As Jack gets ready to kill the pig, he hesitates, and the pig runs away.</li>

					<li data-theme="d">As soon as he returns, Ralph demands an immediate meeting by sounding the conch shell.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">During this first assembly, Ralph lays down certain rules. He announces to the boys that there are no adults on the island; therefore they will need to look after themselves.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">In hopes to keep order, the boys need to lift up their hands. To speak, the chosen boy needs to hold the conch.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Piggy reminds the boys that they could be stuck on the island for a long time, seeing as no one knows they have crashed.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">This thought spreads fear among the boys, as they quickly become silent.</li>

					<li data-theme="d">Simon is not slacking like the other boys. He has been secretly wandering off into the depths of the jungle to explore.</li>
