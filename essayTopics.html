					<li data-theme="b">How is Jack effective in controlling the other boys with the idea of the beast?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Jack manages to manipulate the other boys to look at him as their leader through the use of the beast.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The beast is a non-existing creature that Jack convinces the others is a dangerous and plausible threat to their survival.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The others in the group come to fear the beast as well as idolize it and Jack uses their beliefs about the beast to fuel his position as the groups leader.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The beast seems to relate to religious ideology as it plays the role of god as the boys both fear and idolize the beast. Every action they do relates to the beast and  how to please it and not succumb to its wrath.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The group even leaves the head of a pig as a sacrifice to the beast.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The pagan worship of the beast allows Jack to control the group as only he is aware of the beast being fictional.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The belief of the beast also causes the group to lose any desire for civilization and structure as their existence instead begins to revolve around the beast and a savage lifestyle.</li>

					<li data-theme="b">The two characters Ralph and Simon both seem to be good intentioned characters, however there seems to be a difference in their goodness, compare and contrast their intentions.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">As the two characters seem to develop it is clear that both Ralph and Simon have good intentions and seek to retain a system of order on the island.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Both seem to put the others ahead of their own well being.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">However as the novel goes along it becomes clear that there is a different motivation for each of the two to remain a good person.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">It seems as if Ralph has learned the moral guidelines that he follows, despite deep down having urges to live like a savage.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Meanwhile Simon proves that he is an innately good person whose morality could not possibly be swayed by the hostile conditions the island presents.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">In the end despite Ralph seemingly having more potential as a leader it is in fact Simon who understands the island at a far deeper level than any other character.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He seems to recognize that the beast on the island is not a real creature but instead the characters inner desire for savagery, and only he is not effected by the beast in any sense.</li>
