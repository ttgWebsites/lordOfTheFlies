					<li data-theme="d">Lord of the Flies tells a fictional story set during a period of nuclear war. 
					This topic of literature was quite popular during the time period this book was written, and Lord of the
					Flies is perhaps one of the more famous books in this genre. The novel tells the story of a group of young boys 
					stranded on an island after a plane, on which they were travelling in, crashes. The only survivors of the crash 
					are several boys under the age of 13. The survivors band together and a hierarchy of leadership forms as the group
					comes to know each other (not everyone that survived the crash was acquainted with one another before arriving on the island). 
					Two leaders seem to emerge among the boys, Ralph and Jack. As time on the island wears on the two separate the group and Ralph
					and Jack head in separate ways to try and survive the island. The novel follows their experiences on the island and the savagery 
					that ensues once the boys are left to fend for themselves. One group seems to live by a more civilized code in which they work
					together to survive while the other group seems to live like savages. The conflicting groups are at odds with one another and
					their conflict is depicted throughout. Eventually the boys are rescued, but not all survive the struggle of island life.</li>
