					<li data-theme="c">Golding does a masterful job contrasting the two lifestyles and showing how they interact</li>
					<li data-theme="c">His writing makes one sympathize for Ralph and his group of hard working civilized boys, while at the same time not feel sorry for the boys led by Jack who have resorted to savagery</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The novel helps show the benefits and downfalls from each type of lifestyle, and also goes to show that some humans just aren't cut out to live in a civilized nature, and that deep down we are all savages in a sense, it all depends on whether one can control the savage in them</li>

					<li data-theme="c">A desire to survive the island has transformed many of them into a savage, every man for himself, lifestyle</li>
					<li data-theme="c">In doing so, compassion and civility has been forgotten, as every effort has been taken to survive</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Golding suggests through his writing that everyone is a savage deep down, and that certain circumstances are what bring it out in some people</li>
					<li data-theme="c">At the end of the novel, the young boys are far from the people they originally arrived on the island as, some better, some far worse</li>
